1. Stop-Motion & Experimental Animation
These types add variety and bring a tactile, artistic feel:

    The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) – Tim Burton's cult classic.
    Coraline (2009) – A darker stop-motion tale by Laika Studios.

2. Western Cult & Alternative Animations
Adding a few more Western animations known for niche appeal:

    Anomalisa (2015) – Stop-motion for adults, directed by Charlie Kaufman.
    The Triplets of Belleville (2003) – French animation with quirky storytelling.

3. Eastern European Gems
Adding more from Soviet and Eastern European animation traditions:

    Tale of Tales (1979) – By Yuri Norstein, considered one of the greatest animated shorts.
    The Old Man and the Sea (1999) – A Russian-Canadian production using unique oil-paint-on-glass techniques.

4. Japanese Animation (Lesser-Known Titles)
Your list includes many Ghibli films and key anime classics. Consider these underrated or cult entries:

    Mind Game (2004) – Directed by Masaaki Yuasa, a surreal cult masterpiece.
    A Thousand and One Nights (1969) and Cleopatra (1970) are listed, but more 70s/80s gems could be included:
    Night on the Galactic Railroad (1985) – A melancholic, philosophical anime.
    Tamala 2010: A Punk Cat in Space (2002) – An underground sci-fi gem.
    Tekkonkinkreet (2006) – A unique, visual anime film directed by Michael Arias.

5. Modern Adult Animation
Recent animations with cult followings or serious artistic merit:

    The Spine of Night (2021) – A modern take on adult animation with a style inspired by Bakshi's work.
    Loving Vincent (2017) – An oil-painted animation on the life of Van Gogh.
    I Lost My Body (2019) – A French film combining surrealism and emotional storytelling.

6. Sci-Fi and Cyberpunk Additions
You already have Ghost in the Shell and Akira, but sci-fi/cyberpunk could be enhanced:

    A Scanner Darkly (2006) – A trippy adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s novel.
    Redline (2009) – A high-octane, cult-favorite sci-fi anime.
